# Root-Finder

A GUI implemented program using Matlab.

This program allows the user to solve equations using the numerical analysis methods : Bisection , false position , newton , fixed point and Secant. The equation graph is drawn and the elapsed time to get the approximate root is calculated .

Single mode is available as u can check each step in the table to reach the final approximate root.
